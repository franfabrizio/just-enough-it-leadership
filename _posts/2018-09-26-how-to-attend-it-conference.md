I've spent the last two days at an IT conference. I love the opportunity to get out of the office and learn new things. Conferences can be inspiring and eye opening, but they can be overwhelming, too.

Over my career I've come to realize that there's an art to attending an IT conference, an art that no one teaches you how to do. When I was younger, I would pour over the entire agenda, circling everything that sounded interesting. I would show up and attend everything I could, filling every time slot - it was always agonizing when there were three different things I wanted to go to in one time slot.

About halfway through the conference I would start to wear out, but I'd press on, and between the brain slog all day and the networking events at night, I'd stagger across the finish line at the end and fly home exhausted. Worst of all, I would be swamped with catch-up work when I got back to the office, and before I knew it, months had gone by and I didn't really get a chance to do much with what I had learned.

Over time, I started to approach conferences differently, and now I have a much more strategic approach to them, for both myself and my staff. Here's a list of my collected wisdom about attending IT conferences.

## Conference Attending Tips for Yourself

### Choosing which Conferences to Attend

1. Before even looking for conferences to attend, ask yourself "What are the critical skills/topics/technologies I need to get better at/more informed about/up to date with this year?" I do this annually as part of my performance review self-evaluation - I set a professional development goal with my top priorities listed.

1. As you learn about conferences, keep a running list of them. I keep a list in Evernote of about 20 across common topic areas... in my case, Python, Ruby, APIs, IT leadership/management, software architecture, and so on. I add to the list as I hear about events, and I delete from the list if I look into one and realize it's not a good match, or if I attend one and it's a dud.

1. Now that you have your priorities and a list of interesting conferences, you can pick a few that would fit the bill that you want to keep your eye on in the coming year. Throw a reminder on your calendar a couple of months out from the conference.

1. When you hit the reminder, take a quick look over the agenda. You're not trying to pick specific sessions yet; just a gut feeling of whether it looks good or not. Hopefully you find one or two that you're excited about!

### Prepping for the Conference

1. Block some time out in the week before the conference. Sit down and make a list of 2-3 questions you want to answer at this conference. Try to be as specific as possible. This might be a good time to collaborate with your supervisor or your team to make sure you've really got a handle on what you want to discover.

1. Now go over the schedule in depth and pick your sessions. Here's where that list of questions comes in handy; it helps you focus and narrow down the choices.

1. I always block out a couple of hours the day before I travel to try to tie up as many loose ends at work as possible. You want to try to minimize distractions while you're at the conference, and also, you want your brain to be calm and ready to learn, not thinking about the problems you left back at the office.

1. Also block out a few hours in the days or week after you return, to give yourself time for synthesis and to start doing some of the after-conference items I list below.

### At the Conference

It's go time! You hit the conference, there's a buzz in the air, and you're ready to learn!

1. Note-taking strategy. Listen to the speaker. Resist the urge to write down a synopsis of each slide. Trust me - these notes look like they make a lot of sense when you write them, but you'll be scratching your head in a few weeks when you are reviewing them and trying to figure out what they meant. Think about those questions you are trying to answer. What is the speaker saying that is relevant to those? Is she saying something that gives you and idea of something you want to try back at the office, or something you should tell your colleague? Are you noticing a theme emerging across sessions? Write those insights down, not a copy of the notes. I take my notes in Evernote, but use whatever works for you. One trick I have is that I write TODO next to anything that's an action item - a book I want to read, a technology to look into further, or something I want to tell someone. That makes it easier to put together my action list later.

1. And for the love of all that is holy, do NOT live tweet every other thing the speaker says like it is wisdom being handed down from the ancients. How did this ever become a thing? Twitter is not your notebook, people.

1.  If there's a time slot where none of the sessions fit, I suggest you not go to anything. Use that time to synthesize what you're learning, take care of urgent stuff back at the office so you aren't swamped upon return, or just take a walk and clear your head. It's ok and it doesn't mean that you are wasting the investment made on the conference.

1. Similarly, if you're getting brain fried, step away and recharge. I used to never do that, afraid I was going to miss something. Now, missing a session or two for a quick rest up in the hotel room or a quick visit to a museum nearby is sometimes the smartest choice.

1. If the speaker doesn't hold your interest, it's totally ok to get up and leave the room. What you shouldn't do is stay in the room and go back to hacking on your latest project or chatting on Slack. Having your neighbor tippity tapping on their laptop the whole time while clearly not paying attention to the speaker is surprisingly annoying. It's kind of become culturally ok to do this at conferences, but I don't agree with it. Speakers understand that their topic isn't the right fit for everyone, so it's fine to just quietly leave the room.

1. It can be helpful to spend a little time synthesizing your thoughts each night while everything is still fresh in your mind. What were the key takeaways and themes of the day? What are the action items you want to tackle when you get home?

1. Skip the swag (ok - unless it's _really_ cool). The world doesn't need any more tee shirts or squishy toys or cheap phone battery packs or beer coozies. I've just stopped taking it. This extends to the conference bag - I politely decline it and just use my backpack. Something cool happened at the conference I was just at. A vendor decided that instead of swag, they were going to take that money and donate it to charity, and the attendees got to vote on how to split it up among a couple of different choices. What a great idea!

1. At least dip your toe into the "hallway track". The hallway track is all the casual conversation going on outside the session rooms and during the breaks. I used to avoid this like the plague - I'm an introvert and striking up conversations with strangers doesn't come naturally to me. But I started to do this more, and it's been worth getting over the initial discomfort. It's not too hard to ask someone "How's the conference going for you?" while standing in the line for lunch or sharing an elevator. Most of the time it's a pleasant chat and maybe you find some common tech ground to talk about. Sometimes, you find a kindred spirit to hang with for dinner or the bar that evening. And every once in a while, it turns into a true friendship or work partnership. Last year, I went up to a speaker after his talk because he was doing work similar to mine. A few dinners, some Slack chats, and a meetup at another conference later, and we've built a mashup of our two data sources and are hoping to present a talk about it at this year's conference. You never know what can happen.

1. Take care of your body part 1 - food. Conferences are an endless supply of caffeinated beverages, carbs, lunch with dessert, mid-day treats, and free alcohol in the evening. It's so easy to idly consume 3x your normal daily caffeine and your daily calories. You can pull this off when you're in you're twenties, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea. And when you start to get to my age, you really start to feel it. So, be good to yourself. Skip some of the carbs. Decline the pie a la mode with lunch (seriously, that was on offer today at this conference). Drink a lot of water. Sit down for a real breakfast, with some fruit and dairy and maybe a little protein.

1. Take care of your body part 2 - exercise. While you're abusing your body with poor food choices, you're also sitting on your butt all day for 3, 4 or 5 days in a row. Try to find some time to exercise. I love going to conferences on the west coast because it means I'm going to be up before dawn (since I live in the Central time zone). I go for a long walk at sunrise (or bike ride if I'm somewhere with bike share) and watch the city wake up. I try to find a local diner or cafe a mile or two away where I can get a real breakfast. I've come to love this little tradition of mine. It clears my head, I see parts of the city I wouldn't otherwise see, and I feel better for the rest of the day. I've even been known to set an alarm on the east coast just so I can do this when I'm in Boston, NYC or DC too. When else can you have the Lincoln Memorial all to yourself?! If you're not an early bird, you can exercise during the breaks or walk to dinner instead.

### Back at the Office

This is the most important phase: if you don't take action with what you've learned, then why did you go to the conference in the first place?

1. Make a list of action items ASAP. I try to do this throughout the conference itself, but if you didn't, do it now.

1. Think about what you learned at the conference that would be useful for others. Now share that. Give a presentation, host a brown bag lunch, whatever. Just try to share some of what you learned with your colleagues - the act of teaching and talking about it will help cement the lessons for you.

1. Send your boss a quick note to say thanks for supporting your professional development, and share one or two things that you learned or experienced that would resonate with them.

1. If the conference posts videos of the sessions, go back to the web site and watch any that you weren't able to attend but wanted to, or re-watch any that you felt were particularly great. Maybe do this with colleagues.

1. Start using what you learned immediately. If you went to a software architecture conference and learned a new technique for creating architecture diagrams, convert some of your existing diagrams. If you went to a Python conference and learned about Flask, write a small Flask app from scratch. If you went to an IT management conference and learned about new ways to engage with your team, put them into practice in your 1:1 meetings upon your return. Whatever it is, don't delay finding excuses to put new skills to use. In my experience, if you don't try in the first couple of weeks back, you're unlikely to ever do it - life gets in the way.

1. Despite what I just said in the last point, keep revisiting that list of action items weekly until you've done everything you wanted to do or made an explicit decision not to do it. Just the act of having to confront them weekly makes it more likely you'll eventually do it. Although it's not ideal, I had one year where it took me NINE MONTHS to get back to the followups to a conference I had gone to, and I'm so glad I did - it proved to be very valuable, even with the delay. (Confession: writing this blog post has been on my todo list for months!)

## Helping your Staff Attend Conferences

I wanted to finish off with a few things I do with my staff when they attend conferences. The big theme is to hold them accountable for turning a conference trip into real value for themselves and the organization, but then uphold your part of the bargain by giving them the time, space and guidance needed to succeed. Here are some specifics:

1. I help them craft an annual professional development plan, and after we agree with where they should spend their energy, I suggest a few conferences for them to look at in the coming year.

1. When they pick a conference they want to go to, I ask them to do the 2-3 questions exercise I mentioned above. We then review those questions before they leave, usually refining them, adding my perspective as to what's going to be most valuable for the organization or adding some things in that I know another team might benefit from.

1. Run interference for your team members while they're away. Don't have them call back into meetings, don't email them, don't bother them on Slack - give them the space they need to fully engage in the conference.

1. When they're back, in your next 1:1 go over their 2-3 question list and talk about what they learned and what they'd like to bring back into the office environment. Set an expectation that you are going to be looking for them to have increased their value to the organization by attending this conference. Then help them achieve those goals by championing them and making space for that work.

1. Insist that they participate in a debriefing for the rest of the staff. This can take many forms. One common one I use is the "share the top 3 things you learned" 15 minute talk in our monthly all-IT meetings. Sometimes they do a fuller, one hour workshop or presentation if it's something critical or with wide appeal. On occasion I've asked them to write a blog post for our site. Sometimes they host a video viewing of 1 or 2 of the most impactful talks with discussion afterward. Just get them engaging with their peers about what they learned.

1. Whenever possible I try to send multiple people to a conference. So many benefits! Whether it's having a partner around to make the social events more palatable, being able to pair program on a new idea right away in the lobby, dividing and conquering when there are too many interesting sessions... attending with one or more colleagues can be great for team building and make the experience more valuable for the whole organization. Plus, when they return, they can tag team to do the debriefing.

1. Finally, although this is a post about conferences, something I've tried to do once a year for the past few years is to bring a major training opportunity to our office. We've done a week-long Python for Data Science course, we've done an API Program deep dive week, and so on. If there's a major initiative or technology that impacts your entire team, it can be more effective to bring the training to you. These weeks have been great for learning and for team building, and have served as accelerators for some major initiatives. If you go this route, commit to it fully and clear the decks of as much other work as possible, so that it feels like a special week and folks can concentrate on the topic at hand. We use a strict "no other work from 10am - 4:30pm" rule on these weeks - giving folks a bit of time at the beginning and end of the day to put out any fires that come up.

## Conclusion
