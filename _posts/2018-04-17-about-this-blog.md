Raise your hand if you are an IT leader of some sort - leader of people, leader of projects, whatever.
Good! Now keep your hand up if you started out your career wanting to be an IT leader... Not a lot of hands up, are there?
It's not surprising - most of us got our start because we love tinkering with technology and being able to build systems
and software to solve problems. Our industry has a reputation for taking excellent engineers and thrusting them into leadership
roles whether they are prepared for them or not, and sometimes whether they want them or not! It's a persona I think of as The
Accidental IT Leader, and our workplaces are full of them. I'm one, I'm surrounded by others, and since you're here,
I bet you're one or you have one nearby.

As engineers, when this happens to us we sometimes view leadership as just another engineering problem to solve.
We can fall into common trap of trying to take what works in our technical role and applying it to our leadership role. And sometimes
we minimize our leadership role and retreat to our techie roots that feel more familiar and comfortable.

But effective IT leadership requires consistent attention. It draws upon an entirely different skillset than the one we honed hacking on
code or systems or networks. Suddenly we need to get good at things like project management, stakeholder engagement,
performance evaluation, strategic planning... and the hardest of all, leading PEOPLE! These tasks exercise
different skills than our tech work, and if we don't pay attention and cultivate those skills, leadership isn't going to be very
fun or successful.

Few of us are taught those skills or are in any way formally prepared to take on a leadership role. It's usually a trial by fire,
and we all know sad stories of great engineers who turned out to be lousy leaders. When I was thrust into a leadership role, I didn't
want to become one of those sad stories, so I made a promise to myself to give the leadership part of my role equal attention
to the technical part of my role, and to treat it like an important component of my career and professional development. Now, 10+
years into the journey and lots of mistakes and hard work later, I've learned a bit about this leadership thing, and I'm still learning every day.

I'm at the point in my career (a.k.a. there's more gray hair than there used to be...) where I'm starting to think about how to give
back to an industry and community that's treated me very well and has created a lot of opportunities for me and my family. With this blog, I hope
to share with you some hard-earned lessons, discuss pragmatic management techniques, and create spaces for a community of accidental IT leaders to go on this
journey together, learning from and encouraging each other along the way. 

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find this space insightful and rewarding. Please share your thoughts - I still have lots to learn!
