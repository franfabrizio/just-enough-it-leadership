title: What's This Blog About?

Raise your hand if you are an IT manager of some sort - manager of people, manager of projects, whatever.
Good! Now keep your hand up if you started out your career wanting to be a manager... Not a lot of hands up, are there?
It's not surprising - our industry has a reputation for taking excellent engineers and thrusting them into management
roles, whether they are prepared for them or not, and sometimes whether they want them or not! It's what I call The
Accidental IT Manager, and our workplaces are full of them. I'm one, I'm surrounded by others, and since you're here,
I bet you're one or you have one nearby!

As engineers, when this happens to us we tend to view management as just another engineering problem to solve.
We often fall into common traps of trying to take what works in our technical role and applying it to our management role, or
minimizing our management role altogether and falling back to our techie roles that feel more familiar and comfortable.
But effective IT management requires commitment and demands an entirely different skillset than the one we honed hacking on
code or systems or networks. Suddenly we need to get good at things like project management, business stakeholder engagement,
performance evaluation, strategic planning... and the messiest of all, managing PEOPLE! These tasks exercise
different skills than our tech work, and if we don't pay attention and cultivate those skills, management isn't going to be very
fun or successful.

Few of us are taught those skills or are in any way formally prepared to take on a management role. It's usually a trial by fire,
and we all know sad stories of great engineers who turned out to be lousy managers. When I was thrust into the management role, I didn't
want to become one of those sad stories, so I made a promise to myself to give the management part of my role equal attention
to the technical part of my role, and to treat it like a first-class citizen of my career and professional development. Now, 10+
years into the journey and lots of mistakes and hard work later, I've learned a bit about this management thing, and I'm still learning every day.

I'm at the point in my career (a.k.a. there's more gray hair than there used to be...) where I'm starting to think about how to give
back to an industry and community that's treated me very well and has created a lot of opportunities for me and my family. With this blog, I hope
to share with you some hard-earned lessons, discuss pragmatic management techniques, and create spaces for a community of accidental IT managers to go on this
journey together, learning from and encouraging each other along the way. If you make an honest commitment to the effort, you can be successful
at IT management and you can do it while remaining true to your techie roots. You might even have a little bit of fun doing it!

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find this space insightful and rewarding. Please share your thoughts - I still have lots to learn!
