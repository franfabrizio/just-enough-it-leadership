To put the spoiler right at the beginning of this post, this blog is going to cover both IT leadership and IT management. Why? Because while they're definitely two separate topic areas, it's almost always the case that both skillsets are needed by the same person (with some exceptions, keep reading).

Much has been written about the differences between management and leadership. In recent years, the tone of the narrative too often boils this distinction down to a false dichotomy that goes something like this: "Leaders lead through building trust, managers manage by exerting control. Leading is good and modern and forward-thinking, managing is bad and outdated and close-minded."

This is nonsense. The reality is that you need both effective leadership and effective management if you're going to deliver on your mission. The two have a yin and yang relationship, and while it's definitely possible to do one well without the other, people on your team who are skilled in both disciplines are extremely valuable (and rare).

Here's how I conceptualize these two distinct roles:

A good IT Manager:
* Is an excellent tactician
* Focuses on executing on the mission and meeting goals and objectives.
* Spends a lot of time thinking about how and when questions
* Needs to be good at planning and organizing work
* Communicates effectively by gathering information, disseminating status, and clearly parsing and explaining highly detailed information
* Is a good listener and is responsive to the needs of the people on the team
* Has formal authority for tasks like project planning, work assignment, hiring, supervision and/or performance evaluation

A good IT Leader:
* Is an excellent strategist
* Focuses on developing strategy and vision
* Spends a lot of time thinking about what and why questions
* Needs to be good at seeing big picture and developing vision for the future
* Communicates effectively by inspiring, motivating, and connecting information into themes, patterns and narratives
* Challenges the status quo and is innovation-minded
* Does not need formal authority to do any of this and does not need to be in a management position

As we often say in computer science, naming is hard, and the naming of IT job roles is no exception. We often label people "managers" or "leaders" when in reality the job duties requires skills from both roles. For instance, a "Team Lead" may be the one tasked with sprint planning, which requires the excellent organization and information management skills of a manager, while a "Software Development Manager" might be tapped to develop a 3-year vision to move towards a unified software architecture pattern across the entire product portfolio, a task which requires an ability to see big picture trends and envision a long-term roadmap while gaining buy-in from the various stakeholders throughout the organization.
