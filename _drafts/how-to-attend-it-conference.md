I've spent the last two days at an IT conference. I love the opportunity to get out of the office and learn new things. Conferences can be inspiring and eye opening. But they can be overwhelming, too.

Over my career I've come to realize that there's a bit of an art to attending an IT conference. No one teaches you how to attend a conference. When I was younger, I would pour over the entire agenda, circling everything that sounded interesting. I would show up and attend everything I could - it was always agonizing when there were three different things I wanted to go to in one time slot.

About halfway through the conference I would start to wear out, but I'd press on, and between the brain slog all day and the networking events at night, I'd stagger across the finish line at the end of the conference, and fly home exhausted. Worst of all, I would be swamped with catch-up work when I got back to the office, and before I knew it, months had gone by and I didn't really get a chance to do much with what I had learned.

Over time, I started to approach conferences differently, and now I have a much more strategic approach to them, for both myself and my staff. Here's a list of my collected wisdom about attending IT conferences.

##Conference Attending Tips for Yourself

###Choosing which Conferences to Attend

1. Before even looking for conferences to attend, ask yourself "What are the critical skills/topics/technologies I need to get better at/more informed about/up to date with this year?" I do this annually as part of my performance review self-evaluation - I set a professional development goal with my top priorities listed.

1. As you learn about conferences, keep a running list of them. There's nothing worse than hearing someone recommend a conference, and then months go by and you can't remember what it was. I keep a list in Evernote of about 20 across common topic areas... in my case, Python, Ruby, APIs, IT leadership/management, software architecture, and so on. I add to the list as I hear about events, and I delete from the list if I look into one and realize it's not a good match, or if I attend one and it's a dud.

1. Now that you have your priorities and a list of interesting conferences, you can pick a few that would fit the bill that you want to keep your eye on in the coming year. Throw a reminder on your calendar a couple of months out from the conference.

1. When you hit the reminder, take a quick look over the agenda. You're not trying to pick specific sessions yet; just a gut feeling of whether it looks good or not. If so, register.

### Prepping for the Conference

1. Block some time out in the week before the conference. Sit down and make a list of 2-3 questions you want to answer at this conference. Try to be as specific as possible. This might be a good time to collaborate with your supervisor or your team to make sure you've really got a handle on what you want to discover.

1. Now go over the schedule in depth and pick your sessions. Here's where that list of questions comes in handy; it helps you focus and narrow down the choices. If there's a time slot where none of the sessions fit, don't go to anything! Use that time to synthesize what you're learning, take care of urgent stuff back at the office so you aren't swamped upon return, or just take a walk and clear your head. It's ok and it doesn't mean that you are wasting the investment made on the conference.

1. I always block out a couple of hours the day before I travel to try to tie up as many loose ends at work as possible. You want to try to minimize distractions while you're at the conference, and also, you want your brain to be calm and ready to learn, not thinking about the problems you left back at the office.

### At the Conference

It's go time! You hit the conference, there's a buzz in the air, and you're ready to learn!

1. Note-taking strategy. Listen to the speaker. Resist the urge to write down a synopsis of each slide. Trust me - these notes look like they make a lot of sense when you write them, but you'll be scratching your head in a few weeks when you are reviewing them and trying to figure out what they meant. Think about those questions you are trying to answer. What is the speaker saying that is relevant to those? Is she saying something that gives you and idea of something you want to try back at the office, or something you should tell your colleague? Are you noticing a theme emerging across sessions? Write those insights down, not a copy of the notes. I take my notes in Evernote, but use whatever works for you. One trick I have is that I write TODO next to anything that's an action item - a book I want to read, a technology to look into further, or something I want to tell someone. That makes it easier to put together my action list later.

1. And for the love of all that is holy, do NOT live tweet every other thing the speaker says like it is wisdom being handed down from the ancients. How did this ever become a thing? Twitter is not your notebook, people.

1. If the speaker doesn't hold your interest, it's totally ok to get up and leave the room. What you shouldn't do is stay in the room and go back to hacking on your latest project or chatting on Slack. Having your neighbor tippity tapping on their laptop the whole time while clearly not paying attention to the speaker is surprisingly annoying. It's kind of become culturally ok to do this at conferences, but I don't agree with it. Speakers totally understand that their topic isn't the right fit for everyone, so it's fine to just quietly leave the room.

1. It can be helpful to spend a little time synthesizing your thoughts each night while everything is still fresh in your mind. What were the key takeaways and themes of the day? What are the action items you want to tackle when you get home?

1. If you're getting brain fried, step away and recharge. I used to never do that, afraid I was going to miss something. Now, missing a session or two for a quick rest up in the hotel room or a quick visit to a museum nearby is sometimes the smartest choice.

1. Skip the swag (ok - unless it's _really_ cool). The world doesn't need any more tee shirts or squishy toys or cheap phone battery packs or beer coozies. I've just stopped taking it. Something really cool happened at the conference I was just at. A vendor decided that instead of swag, they were going to take that money and donate it to charity. And the attendees got to vote on how to split it up among a couple of different choices. What a great idea!

1. Dip your toe into the "hallway track". The hallway track is all the casual conversation going on outside the session rooms and during the breaks. I used to avoid this like the plague - I'm an introvert and striking up conversations with strangers doesn't come naturally to me. But I started to do this more, and it's been worth getting over the initial discomfort.

It's not too hard to ask someone "How's the conference going for you?" while standing in the line for lunch or sharing an elevator. Most of the time it's a pleasant chat and maybe you find some common tech ground to talk about. Sometimes, you find a kindred spirit to hang with for dinner or the bar that evening. And every once in a while, it turns into a true friendship or work partnership. Last year, I went up to a speaker after his talk because he was doing work similar to mine. A few dinners, some Slack chats, and a meetup at another conference later, and we've built a mashup of our two data sources and are hoping to present a talk about it at this year's conference.

1. Take care of your body part 1 - food. Conferences are an endless supply of caffeinated beverages, carbs, lunch with dessert, mid-day treats, and free alcohol in the evening. It's so easy to idly consume 3x your normal daily caffeine and 4x your daily calories. You can pull this off when you're in you're twenties, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea. And when you start to get to my age, you really start to feel it. So, be good to yourself. Skip some of the carbs. Decline the pie a la mode with lunch (seriously, that was on offer today at this conference). Go for the water sometimes. Sit down for a real breakfast, with some fruit and dairy and maybe a little protein.

1. Take care of your body part 2 - exercise. While you're abusing your body with poor food choices, you're also sitting on your butt all day. And you do this 3, 4 or 5 days in a row. Try to find some time to exercise. I love going to conferences on the west coast because it means I'm going to be up before dawn (since I live in the Central time zone). I go for a long walk at sunrise (or bike ride if I'm somewhere with bike share) and watch the city wake up. I try to find a local diner or cafe a mile or two away where I can get a real breakfast. I've come to love this little tradition of mine. It clears my head, I see parts of the city I wouldn't otherwise see, and I feel better for the rest of the day. I've even been known to set an alarm on the east coast just so I can do this when I'm in Boston or DC too. When else can you have the Lincoln Memorial all to yourself?! If you're not an early bird, you can exercise during the breaks or walk to dinner instead.

### Back at the Office

This is the most important phase: if you don't take action with what you've learned, then why did you go to the conference in the first place?

1. Make a list of action items ASAP. I try to do this throughout the conference itself, but if you didn't, do it now.
